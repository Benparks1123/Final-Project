Final Project
Sum vs Factorial
        For my final project I wanted to create a simply calculator that compares a number factorial to its sum. Its factorial being the product of the given number multiplied by every number below it. And it’s sum begging the sum of the given number added to every number below it. I already had functions that can perform these given tasks. All that was needed was to create a working calculator that displayed both variables together so they could be compared to one another. To begin I designed a calculator with six different GUI elements. The first being an edit box where a number could be inputted to be ran through the functions. The next was an ‘Enter’ box which when clicked would generate a factorial number and a sum based on the provided number. The next was a label for the sum of the given number as well as a label for the factorial of the given number. Finally two text boxes were required to provide the factorial and sum calculated from the given number. I position each element in a manner that was neat. The Sum label was positioned of the Sum output. The same was for the Factorial label and output. These were positioned next to each other. Underneath the output values for each was the edit box for the input value and the enter box to run the calculator. The hardest portion of the code was figuring out how to make the enter button run the functions and how to make the answer values display the correct value from the given number. After some tinkering with the code I have changed the answer elements to push button that will display the answer. This allows the user to calculate either the sum and/or the factorial. I was not able to fix the push buttons to display the output value of either sum or factorial.
